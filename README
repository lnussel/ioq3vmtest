The ioq3 sources must be in .. relative from this file. Run 'make'
to compile everything.

The program 'main' takes a qvm file as argument and the arguments
for the qvm's main function. So e.g. "./main t1.qvm 1 2 3" will tell
you that the return value is five (see t1.c).
comparenative.c is special, it contains tests for almost all
operations. If you just run "./main comparenative.qvm" the program
will run all tests via qvm and and native and compare the results.
